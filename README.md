Left off lastimlementing tradeUpHelper getCombinationInputPrice to multiple each index (if > zero) of the combination with the most efficient minimum price trade up fuel for that rarity, wear, case stattrak level. 

Then I need to design a good array entry output to determine the profitablility  of each per case preselected most efficient skin per wear level within each rarity level. 
In other words, we get the most efficient trade ups for the rarity level price combinations in each case. After that, I need to write testing to ensure all of the previously made functions are working as inteded.
It would be nice to double down on the validity of the preliminary data... I will continue project planning at another time. Now time for some thoughts.

# WRITE A STEAM MARKETPLACE CS:GO MARKET RESEARCH PAPER WITH VIDEO!!!!!!!
- Every commercial item in existence, physical, or digitial, has a derived value. Digital value is both volatile and possibly expensive because the item's lack of utility is incalculably unrealistic. To greater understand the non-mathematical, human minded market behavior of evaluating a 0-utility item, I think it is important to look into social psycology, digital psycology?!, macro and micro economics. With the Steam CS:GO Marketplace having a net total of 1.3 billion dollar asset evaluations (https://liquidsky.com/how-much-is-csgo-market-worth/), it is reasonable to think that a properly executed market evaluation and effective (get-rich-quick) plan could blossom into a small fortune (https://github.com/sshh12). While understanding the psycologoical mindset of a digital consumer good owner is useful, my primary route of thought train is chugging on identifying the formula for real price identification in the market. (Go on to explain the technical requirements for generating analysis results of this query..)


## QUESTIONS/NOTES/THINGS TO RESEARCH:
I originally set out to, and am still extremely hopeful, that I am creating a system of coded procedures to identify and profit off a mathematical formula that defines the value of a weapon by the value placed on the weapons that compose it, the trade up. While, as I said earlier, hope this earns me a slight profit, it is becoming more of a hobby to use what I have discovered to attempt to define the larger counter strike market economy as a whole.
For example: 
- If the previous guns define the value of the next, why are some prices not equal to their theorized price? 
- Do cases with highest prices covert weapons have the highest value lower tier weapons?
- How do the basal weapons develop their price value at all, and over the course of their release?
- What makes the counter strike ecosystem a true fair market, and are their other games like this?
- In other games with fair markets, is there a theoretical mathmatical formula to define the value of items?
