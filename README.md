# CSGOMarketProject THOUGHTS

Left off lastimlementing tradeUpHelper getCombinationInputPrice to multiple each index (if > zero) of the combination with the most efficient minimum price trade up fuel for that rarity, wear, case stattrak level. 

Then I need to design a good array entry output to determine the profitablility  of each per case preselected most efficient skin per wear level within each rarity level. 
In other words, we get the most efficient trade ups for the rarity level price combinations in each case. After that, I need to write testing to ensure all of the previously made functions are working as inteded.
It would be nice to double down on the validity of the preliminary data... I will continue project planning at another time. Now time for some thoughts. 

I originally set out to, and am still extremely hopeful, that I am creating a system of coded procedures to identify and profit off a mathematical formula that defines the value of a weapon by the value placed on the weapons that compose it, the trade up. While, as I said earlier, hope this earns me a slight profit, it is becoming more of a hobby to use what I have discovered to attempt to define the larger counter strike market economy as a whole.
For example: 
- If the previous guns define the value of the next, why are some prices not equal to their theorized price? 
- Do cases with highest prices covert weapons have the highest value lower tier weapons?
- How do the basal weapons develop their price value at all, and over the course of their release?
- What makes the counter strike ecosystem a true fair market, and are their other games like this?
- In other games with fair markets, is there a theoretical mathmatical formula to define the value of items?

LESSON
- Every commercial item in existence, physical, or digitial, has a derived value. Digital value is both volatile and possibly expensive because its untility is incalculably nonrealistic.
